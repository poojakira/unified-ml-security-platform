# Production Operating Contract

## System role

This repository is maintained as a **multi-service ML security integration platform**.

## Production purpose

provide a gateway and normalized service contracts across the portfolio security tools.

## Release gate

A release is promotable only when gateway/integration tests, service health checks, container-compose startup, and dependency/security gates pass.

## Operating requirements

- Configuration must come from explicit environment/config files; secrets must never be committed.
- Production defaults must fail safely when required identity, credentials, artifacts, or dependencies are missing.
- Health/readiness behavior must represent real dependency state where the repository exposes a service.
- Logs and machine-readable outputs must support incident/debug reconstruction without leaking secrets.
- Dependency and security findings at the repository's blocking threshold must stop promotion.
- Public metrics and benchmark claims must identify their dataset, environment, and scope.
- Deployment images/artifacts must be versioned and immutable at promotion time.
- Rollback must be possible without rewriting Git history.

## Evidence boundary

"Production-oriented" describes the engineering and release contract of this repository. It does **not** mean that an external enterprise deployment, penetration test, certification, uptime history, or scale target has occurred unless a separate committed artifact proves it.

## Change management

Main is the supported integration branch. Production changes should be small, reviewable, tested, and tied to observable behavior. Historical benchmark/research material may remain for evidence, but active README, security, runbook, and deployment surfaces must describe the supported runtime rather than an academic or prototype status.
