# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution.

## Before opening a pull request

1. Keep changes scoped and explain the security or engineering reason for them.
2. Add or update tests for behavior changes. Prefer tests that exercise a real failure mode over tests added only to increase a count.
3. Update documentation when a public claim, CLI contract, schema, benchmark, or limitation changes.
4. Do not weaken validation, authentication, or CI checks to make a test pass.

## Local verification

Run:

```bash
python -m pytest tests -q
ruff check .
```

If an optional dependency or external service is required, state that explicitly in the pull request.

## Benchmarks and metrics

Do not update a published metric from a README alone. Include the command, environment, commit, dataset/fixture scope, and raw result or CI evidence needed to reproduce it.

## Security-sensitive changes

For parser, authentication, authorization, sandbox, deserialization, policy, or detection changes, include at least one negative/adversarial test that demonstrates the failure mode being fixed.
